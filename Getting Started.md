# Getting Started
This course is based on two sources:

1. [McCarthy, L., Reas, C., & Fry, B. (2015). Getting Started with P5. js: Making Interactive Graphics in JavaScript and Processing. Maker Media, Inc..](https://p5js.org/books/)
2. [Code! Programming with p5.js](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA)

*These are excellent resources for parents and the older students.*

# Introduction

In the course we will be learning [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) which is a [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) library. Programming courses usually focus on the stucture and theory first. This is boring and often turns students away from coding. p5.js offers a way for students to learn coding via creating interactive graphics. 

Sketching is a way of thinking that is playful and quick. The goal is to explore many ideas in a short amount of time. Students can start out by sketching on paper them moving the results to code. Ideas for animation and interactions may be sketched with storyboards.


## p5.js Web Editor

We will be using the [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) for the duration of the course. Students are need to have an account setup.

To to https://editor.p5js.org/ to make an account.
